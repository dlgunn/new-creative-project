    <h2>What is storywriter?</h2>
    <p>
      Storywriter is a collaborative story-writing project. Work together with
      people all around the world to write the greatest story! Each story is
      divided into sections that you can upvote and downvote. Comment about what
      you like or what you think should be changed. If you think the story
      should go differently, feel free to submit your version of the story!
    </p>
    <h2>Who can edit stories?</h2>
    <p>
      As of right now, anyone can edit stories or add new sections to stories.
      In the future we will be implementing accounts and authentification, along
      with a git-style version system.
    </p>
    <h2>What else is planned for the future?</h2>
    <p>
      We hope to implement a voting system similar to stack exchange. Each story
      will have multiple sections that you can switch between. If you prefer one
      section over another, you can upvote it and make it the first option
      shown.
    </p>
    <h2>What else should I do?</h2>
    <p>hahaha give me all your money</p>
    <p>Also go write your own story! But don't make it stupid</p>
